# L'Or√©al Brandstorm: Strategic Digital Innovation Proposal
The project aim was to propose L'Or√©al an innovative value proposition by levariging new digital technologies. 
After analyzing the cosmetic industry's trends, we designed a seasonal personalization service for L'Or√©al. By tapping into the customization trend, we offered curated seasonal selections of cosmetics. To make our solution stand out, we introduced an NFT-based gamification component, positioning L'Or√©al at the crossroads of beauty and digital innovation.

The project was part of the "Strategy and Marketing" course.
